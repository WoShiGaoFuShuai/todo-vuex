# TODO-POMODORO & TIMER

![main-picture](git_images/Main.jpg)

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

Hi! ðŸ‘‹
This project has a main goal to keep you productive.

You can use it to keep track of all your tasks.
For those tasks that require time-controlling (for instance, you have to learn something for 30 minutes per day) you can use a timer.

In the app you can:

- Create new todos;
- Delete todos;
- Edit todos;
- Tick done when you finished the task;
- Push todos from global todos (store for all todos) into daily todos (todos that is more important and should be done in the first place);
- Push todos into a timer page, if it is required time-controlling;
- Open a timer to track how many minutes/hours you'd been working;
- Change timer settings and adjust them for your needs;
- Change category names; (as a default categories are: Work, Education, Hobby, Sport, Other) if you need other names for any category you can change it in the settings;

ðŸ’» This project was created via:

- Vue 2;
- Vuetify;
- Vuex;

## Features that you may like:

### Sorted list of all tasks (global, daily, deleted, done)

![example-of-sorted-tasks](git_images/Daily-sort.jpg)

All task are sorted by the deadline. It means if you have 3 tasks:

- the 1st task has deadline on 22nd of October;
- the 2nd task has deadline on 20th of October;
- the 3rd task has deadline on 25th of October;

you will get:

- the 2nd task;
- the 1st task;
- the 3rd task;

and if the deadline is today you will see "TODAY" in your task;

### Expired tasks

If the task is expired (deadline is already gone), the task will be in grey color
